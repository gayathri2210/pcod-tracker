# Compressed files if they are just archives of data already present

# Large data files if not essential for the app to run or if too big for GitHub
# You might want to commit your .csv and .xlsx files if the model needs them at runtime
# OR if they are used by your retraining script which IS part of the repo.
# If they are just raw data you processed once and won't use directly in the deployed app,
# then consider ignoring them. For now, let's assume you want to commit them.

# Other Python scripts that are not part of the core Flask app or retraining,
# if they are just for exploration or old versions (bias.py, gui.py, gui2.py, kmeans.py)
# bias.py
# gui.py
# gui2.py
# kmeans.py 
# Consider if these are truly part of the project you want to share/deploy.
# If they are just scratch files, add them to .gitignore.
# If they are important utility scripts, keep them.
